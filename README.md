# OpenTableHackMT

This is a hackathon project that I and my teammates developed at HackMT 2020 with L3Harris for Open Table in Nashville.

We originally worked through Gitlab on this project: https://gitlab.com/l3harrishackmt/opentablehackmt

OpenTableHackMT is a web application developed in C# using the .NET CORE 2.2 framework as the backend, and Javascript for the frontend.  
The database was created in MySQL and is hosted on AWS RDS. This application utilizes the Google Maps API to implement geolocation features.  
NPM packages to install:  
Npm install jquery  
Npm update react react-dom  
Npm install @material-ui/core  
Npm install @material-ui/icons  
npm install --save google-maps-react
